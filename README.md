### Classroom Culture

Let's all agree to:

* Avoid bringing distractions into class
* Participate in class
* Be on video during class

### How To Succeed in a Remote Environment
* No distractions during class. This means no cell phones, children around.
* Make sure to speak up and speak out about any problems you are having! Don't be afraid to ask questions during class! Someone else is probably having this same issue!
* Carve out at least 10 hours outside of class a week for review and homework. Expect the next 6 months to be out of the norm for you. If you have to carve out a personal hour during a family vacation, you will have to do this!
* Make use of office hours! Find a time that works for you and don't cancel on your instructors :)
* Hold yourself accountable. Don't let yourself fall behind!

## Group Work Formats
We will be using breakout rooms to get create more personalized learning environments. Make sure to get to know your classmates and use eachother as teachers!
